# Amber's First Experiments
This is my *first repository* for learning to use **GitHub** and all the little curiosities I discover along the way.

The main sources of my learning activities are based on the following tutorials/classes/projects are:
* [First-Contributions Repository](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) on GitHub
* [Intro to earth data scienIce /Git and GitHub class](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/) by Earth Lab of University of Colorado, Boulder 
* Coursera Classes [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github/home/) by Google and [Version Control](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control/home/) by Meta
* Coursera Class [Python and Pandas for Data Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-and-pandas-for-data-engineering-duke/lecture/RqVQi/version-control-with-github) by Duke University

The beginning of explorations in any new direction in life can be daunting and exciting at the same time. I hope to be a lifelong explorer and not be intimidated, but inspired by **"not knowing"**... Seeing it as the beginning of a new adventure...

I hope with continued practice one day it will become second nature to me :)
